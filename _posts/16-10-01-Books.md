## Kirjat {#books_title}

There are many PHP books; sadly some are now quite old and no longer accurate. In particular, avoid books on "PHP 6", a version that will now never exist. The next major release of PHP after 5.6 was "PHP 7", [partly because of this](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php6).

This section aims to be a living document for recommended books on PHP development in general. If you would like your
book to be added, send a PR and it will be reviewed for relevancy.
