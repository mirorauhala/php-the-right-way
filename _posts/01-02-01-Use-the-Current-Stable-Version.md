## K채yt채 uusinta vakaata versiota (8.0) {#use_the_current_stable_version_title}

If you are getting started with PHP, start with the current stable release of [PHP 8.0][php-release]. PHP 8.x adds many [new features](#language_highlights) over the older 7.x and 5.x versions. The engine has been largely re-written, and PHP is now even quicker than older versions. PHP 8.0 is a major update of the language and contains many new features and optimizations.

You should try to upgrade to the latest stable version quickly - PHP 5.6 [is already End of Life](http://php.net/supported-versions.php). Upgrading is easy, as there are not many [backwards compatibility breaks][php-bc]. If you are not sure which version a function or feature is in, you can check the PHP documentation on the [php.net][php-docs] website.
