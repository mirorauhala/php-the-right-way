# Tervetuloa

There's a lot of outdated information on the Web that leads new PHP users astray,
propagating bad practices and insecure code. _PHP: The Right Way_ is an easy-to-read,
quick reference for PHP popular coding standards, links to authoritative tutorials
around the Web and what the contributors consider to be best practices at the present
time.

_There is no canonical way to use PHP_. This website aims to introduce new PHP
developers to some topics which they may not discover until it is too late, and aims
to give seasoned pros some fresh ideas on those topics they've been doing for years
without ever reconsidering. This website will also not tell you which tools to use, but
instead offer suggestions for multiple options, when possible explaining the differences
in approach and use-case.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information
and examples as they become available.
